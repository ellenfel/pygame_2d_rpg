# Maps and Entity Placement in Pygame 2D RPG

## Overview
This project uses the Tiled map editor to design maps and place entities like enemies, objects, and environmental elements. The `.tmx` files in the `tiled/` directory define the layout and properties of the game world. These files are parsed in the game to dynamically create the level.

## How It Works

### 1. Tiled Map Editor
Tiled is a popular tool for creating 2D game maps. In this project:
- **Layers**: Each `.tmx` file contains multiple layers, such as ground, objects, and entities.
- **Tilesets**: The graphical assets used in the map are defined in tilesets, which are linked to the `.tmx` files.
- **Properties**: Custom properties can be added to tiles or objects to define their behavior in the game.

### 2. Parsing `.tmx` Files
The game uses a parser to read `.tmx` files and convert them into game objects. This is typically done using a library like `pytmx` or a custom parser.
- **Tile Layers**: These are used to render the background and environment.
- **Object Layers**: These define the placement of entities like enemies, items, and interactive objects.

### 3. Code Integration
The `level.py` file is responsible for loading the map and creating game objects based on the parsed data.
- **Tiles**: The `Tile` class in `tile.py` is used to create and render individual tiles.
- **Entities**: Entities like enemies and the player are instantiated based on the object layer data.



## Steps to Change Maps and Entities

### 1. Create or Edit a Map
1. Open Tiled and load an existing `.tmx` file or create a new one.
2. Add layers for different elements:
   - **Ground Layer**: For the base tiles.
   - **Object Layer**: For interactive objects.
   - **Entity Layer**: For enemies and other entities.
3. Use the tilesets in the `graphics/` directory to design the map.
4. Add custom properties to objects if needed (e.g., `type: enemy`, `name: goblin`).
5. Save the `.tmx` file in the `tiled/` directory.

### 2. Update the Game Code
1. Open `level.py` and ensure the new `.tmx` file is loaded.
2. Update the parsing logic if new properties or layers are added.
3. Add new entity types to the relevant files (e.g., `enemy.py` for enemies).

### 3. Test the Changes
1. Run the game and load the new map.
2. Verify that all tiles and entities are correctly placed and functioning.
3. Debug any issues by checking the console output or using the `debug.py` tools.

## Best Practices
- Keep the `.tmx` files organized and well-named.
- Use consistent naming conventions for layers and properties.
- Test maps thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
